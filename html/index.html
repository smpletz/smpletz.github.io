                I am currently a junior at Indiana University Bloomington studying web and app design, game development, and computer science. I have been coding for about 7 years now with considerable experience in 8 languages and counting. Although the majority of my experience is in Java and Python, Swift has fascinated me ever since I took a class on it in my Sophomore year. I have since picked up working as a teaching assistant for that same class, allowing me to share my passion with others, as well as deepen my understanding of the language and its limitations.

             My talents in the programming world go beyond Xcode, since I have been working in game programming for almost 2 years now. I first started by working with Unity my sophomore year, where I learned how to use the engine and made 3 total games: a <em>Space Invaders</em> clone, a 3D billiards game, and a platformer with 5 levels. I have since taken multiple classes on game theory and development and am now working with Construct3 to experiment with art and sound. I have primarily worked with platformers and other 2D environments, but am interested in experimenting with more work in the 3D space.</p>
        <p>
            Game development has been a passion of mine for years, and I am proud of the range of skills I have acquired. I will be actively working on new games that I will be showing off in my <a href="https://github.com/smpletz" target="_blank">GitHub</a> repository, so check back regularly!
