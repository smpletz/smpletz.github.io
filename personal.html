        <h2>Where I'm From</h2>
        <div class="description">
            <p>I grew up in the Chicagoland area, just over the border into Indiana. Over the years I&rsquo;ve spent more time in the city, but most of my life has been spent in the flat little towns on the south side of Lake Michigan. Although there isn&rsquo;t much to do there, there is a unique melting pot of people from all around the world who&rsquo;s families came to the United States to work in Chicago. I&rsquo;ve been spoiled with great food all my life, having authentic cuisine from every culture within a short drive. <br><br> I haven&rsquo;t always lived in the Midwest, however, since I was born in Austin, Texas. I lived in the weird city for the first 2-3 years of my life, but moved before I could form any memories. I&rsquo;ve only been back once when I was seven, but look forward to going back sometime (hopefully) soon. <br><br>I currently live in Bloomington for 8/9 months of the year, and its just the right amount of feeling like home and feeling new. The climate and wildlife are mostly the same, but the hilly terrain and mix of people are completly different. Bloomington has become a second home to me, and I&rsquo;ll be sad to leave after I graduate.</p>

        <h2>Hobbies</h2>
        <div class="about">
            <div class="about-text">
                <p>My list of hobbies is pretty lengthy, which is a blessing and a curse. I&rsquo;m always looking to try new things, and many of them tend to stick. Some hobbies are simply sports that I&rsquo;ve played since I was young, such as tennis, but others I&rsquo;ve picked up out of my own interest like thrifting and skateboarding. <br><br>The most constant of my hobbies, however, has been biking. Growing up in the Chicago area, I&rsquo;ve been spoiled with a large system of bike trails built on what were once railroad tracks. Over the summers I make use of every opportunity I have to bike as far as I can on the trails. I hope to carry over this passion in cycling to my time at IU, possibly joining a Little 500 team in the coming school year. <br><br>I&rsquo;ve also had a passion for video games since I was young, which I&rsquo;ve since turned into the beginnings of a career. The freedom of crativity and constant growth of the industry through passion instead of profit has always intrigued me, so I hope to have the same effect on others that others had on me growing up.</p>

        <h2>Interests</h2>
        <div class="description">
            <p>I&rsquo;m ambitous in the life I wish to lead, with a long list of things I want to do and places I want to go before my time is up. Highest up on the list is my desire to live in Japan, which has been a goal of mine for years. The country&rsquo;s culture, history, and scenery are the main draw for me, but what makes it all come together for me is just how well it fits into my career plans. Japan&rsquo;s tech sector, specifically in app and game development, has a lot to offer. I&rsquo;ve been steadily preparing to move there sometime after college, but I plan to stay in the United States for a few years before I leave. <br><br>My day-to-day interests are much less ambitious, with most involving appreciation of art and nature. I&rsquo;m a chronic listener of music, so its rare to find me without headphones on, earbuds in, or speakers running. Ever since I got a turntable a few years ago, I&rsquo;ve been steadily collecting records to listen to while I do my schoolwork or read. I&rsquo;d also like to call myself a cinephile, but have found it difficult to fit in the time to watch movies recently. <br><br>My interest in the outdoors, on the other hand, has only expanded during my time at IU. I have taken multiple classes through IU Outdoor Adventures, even training to become a trip leader for them, which has led me to appreciate the outdoors so much more. I&rsquo;ve become very interested in backpacking and mountain biking since taking courses on them, and would have loved to teach classes on them if it weren&rsquo;t for the scheduling conflicts with my other jobs.</p>
