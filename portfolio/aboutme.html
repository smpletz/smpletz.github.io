        <h2>Academics</h2>
        <div class="description">
            <p>I am currently getting ready for my last year as an undergraduate at Indiana University Bloomington, where I have studied a variety of fields under the programming spectrum. I came to IU as a computer science student with a general idea of the kind of work I wanted to do, but quickly found out the areas I&rsquo;m most passionate about. In my sophomore year I took my first class on mobile app development and found myself enjoying the work I was doing, especially with visual elements. At the same time, I was starting on my game design minor, which was a field I had always been interested in exploring. While continuing on with my game design minor, I switched my degree path to Informatics to focus on web and app development, since many of the courses offered at IU over the subject weren&rsquo;t under the computer science department. The classses I began taking further grew my interest in the work I was doing, largely due to the course where I learned how to work with databases in SQL. Working with databases scratched an itch for me, since I had always been interested in data analysis. I have recently made another change to my degree path because of it, choosing to work towards getting a masters in data science. With the remainder of my time as an undergrad, I will continue to study my areas of passion. I&rsquo;m looking forward to completing my minor in game design, which I feel I&rsquo;ve learned a lot from. What I look forward to most, however, is a course where I&rsquo;ll be designing apps for large companies such as ESPN and Adobe.

        <h2>Career</h2>
        <div class="description">
            <p>After graduating, I plan to make full use of the skills I&rsquo;ve practiced in college. Ideally I&rsquo;ll work with either a focus on design or data analysis in the fields of web/app or game development. Outside of the work I will do for my official career, I plan to make use of my other talents on my own time. The skills I have gained in college will allow me to work on my own and complete full projects. I plan to begin my career by working with companies that can develop and refine my skills, eventually settling on a skillset to focus on. </p>

        <h2>Employment</h2>
        <div class="description">
            <p>I currently work as a teaching assistant for mobile app development in iOS, which has allowed me to maintain practice in the field while I continue my other studies. I&rsquo;ve also been able to work closely with others interested in becoming developers and learn from them. I plan to do the same in the coming semesters with other classes I have taken such as web design and information representation with SQL. I&rsquo;ve also worked at IU Rec Sports for the past two school years, which has allowed me to work with students in a variety of fields. Over the summers I work in construction building bleachers across the Midwest. The job has allowed me to get to know the Chicagoland area better, especially through work with major companies. </p>
